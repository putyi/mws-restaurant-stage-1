#### _Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I have also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t includ any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Open the project

One should use a simple Http server, such as Wamp (for windows.), or Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on their computer. Don't forget to set the value of the used port in dbhelper.js (for Wamp the default is 80, for Python 8000). Then open it via `http://localhost:80`, or `http://localhost:8000`, or any localhost value needed. Start your server first!
